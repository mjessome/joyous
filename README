Joyous
======

About
-----
Joyous is a joystick mapper which allows users to map joystick buttons to
X events. It currently supports sending key presses/releases, full string key
presses, and executing commands.

Configuration
-------------
All button configurations are made through modifications to config.h. Joyous
comes bundled with a sample config.h. JOY_DEV in config.h specifies the default
path to the joystick device, and can also be specified at runtime using the
"--js <path>" command line option.

See customization instructions and examples in config.h, and "--help" for
usage information.

Usage
-----
To use joyous, simply launch the joyous binary. Any key presses will be sent to
the active X window.

Installation
------------
By default installs to /usr/local/bin
    1. Edit config.h to your liking.
    2. run 'make'
    3. run 'make install' (may need to do this as root)

Requirements
------------
    * Linux 2.2 or newer
    * X11
    * XTest must be enabled in your X11 install if you want to send keystrokes,
      or mouse button events.
    * A joystick

Notes
-----
    * Applications are able to disable or not recognize "XTest" events. In the
      case that an application does so, it will not be possible to send key
      presses to it.
    * Based on an outline from br0ke on the Linux Games mailing list.
